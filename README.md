# GoGame - 2D platform game! 
The game was born in front of a university exam related to the subject "development of digital games".
The project consists in the development of a game through the use of the Unity software development platform.
The idea was to create a 2D platform game where the main character has the goal of completing the level in the shortest time possible. The main character will have to overcome traps, kill enemies and collect coins (implemented mechanism for the eventual creation of a store).
The main mechanisms implemented concern the presence of checkpoints and a stopwatch.
The checkpoint mechanism consists in saving the position of the main character and the stopwatch at a given instant.
The stopwatch mechanism allows you to keep track of the time taken to reach the checkpoint or to complete the level (the score relating to the least time is saved).
